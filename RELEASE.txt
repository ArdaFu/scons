==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.4.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.4.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- List modifications to existing features, where the previous behavior
  wouldn't actually be considered a bug

- Override envirionments, created when giving construction environment
  keyword arguments to Builder calls (or manually, through the
  undocumented Override method), were modified not to "leak" on item deletion.
  The item will now not be deleted from the base environment.

FIXES
-----

- PackageVariable now does what the documentation always said it does
  if the variable is used on the command line with one of the enabling
  string as the value: the variable's default value is produced (previously
  it always produced True in this case).
- Temporary files created by TempFileMunge() are now cleaned up on
  scons exit, instead of at the time they're used.  Fixes #4595.
- AddOption now correctly adds short (single-character) options.
  Previously an added short option would always report as unknown,
  while long option names for the same option worked. Short options
  that take a value require the user to specify the value immediately
  following the option, with no spaces (e.g. -j5 and not -j 5).

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

- For consistency with the optparse "add_option" method, AddOption accepts
  an SConsOption object as a single argument (this failed previouly).
  Calling AddOption with the full set of arguments (option names and
  attributes) to set up the option is still the recommended approach.

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed
