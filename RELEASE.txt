- MSVS: prevent overwriting the SCons environment variable SCONS_HOME with the OS
  environment value of SCONS_HOME in the msvs tool.
- MSVC: Fix the detection of Visual Studio 2015 Express ('14.0Exp') by adding a

  at runtime for the location of the VC folder.
- MSVS: Fix the msvs project generation test for MSVS 6.0 to use the correct name of
  the generated project file.

  build of the project file fails.
