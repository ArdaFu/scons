Here is a summary of the changes since 4.7.0:

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Dump() with json format selected now recognizes additional compound types
  (UserDict and UserList), which improves the detail of the display.
  json output is also sorted, to match the default display.
- Python 3.13 changes the behavior of isabs() on Windows. Adjust SCons
  usage of this in NodeInfo classes to avoid test problems.
- Drop duplicated __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods in AliasNodeInfo,
  FileNodeInfo and ValueNodeInfo classes, as they are identical to the
  ones in parent NodeInfoBase and can just be inherited.
