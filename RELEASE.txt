    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.7.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- List new features (presumably why a checkpoint is being released)

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Dump() with json format selected now recognizes additional compound types
  (UserDict and UserList), which improves the detail of the display.
  json output is also sorted, to match the default display.
- Python 3.13 changes the behavior of isabs() on Windows. Adjust SCons
  usage of this in NodeInfo classes to avoid test problems.
- All exceptions during the execution of an Action are now returned by value
  rather than by raising an exception, for more consistent behavior.
  NOTE: With this change, user created Actions should now catch and handle
  expected exceptions (whereas previously many of these were silently caught
  and suppressed by the SCons Action exection code).

FIXES
-----

- OSErrors are now no longer hidden during the execution of Actions.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- Updated Value Node docs.



DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- List visible changes in the way SCons is developed
